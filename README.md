# bacteriaGAN
To attempt to build a relatively large-scale dataset of high-quality, labeled images, this project employs the pix2pix conditional GAN model by Isola et al (2017)  to artificially synthesize images by training on the smaller currently available dataset. For assessment, a image classification model to evaluate if bacterial images can be differentiated accurately when additionally trained on synthesized images is included. 

## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS
- Python 3
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN
## Getting Started

### Accessing data & preparation 
The Digital Images of Bacteria Species dataset (DIBaS), collected by Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland, contains 33 bacteria species with around 20 images for each. All of the samples were stained using the Grammâ€™s method, and evaluated using a 100 times objective. Each original image file is in TIF format, and the size is 2048 x 1532 pixels when converted to PNG format. The dataset has been uploaded to Google Drive for use on this project only, and can be accessed and downloaded from this link using a LionMail account.

### pix2pix train/test

To train and test the pix2pix on our dataset, run `dibas_pix2pix.ipynb` using Google Colab. The contents of the notebook are as follows.

- Clone pix2pix repo 
```
!git clone https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
import os
os.chdir('pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/')
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Load dataset

Requires authentication of Google account with access to data files.
```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/gdrive', force_remount = True)
```
- Prepare dataset

Pix2pix's training requires paired data. A python script to generate training data in the form of pairs of images {A,B}, where A and B are two different depictions of the same underlying scene, is included in pix2pix repo. To use this script, create folder /path/to/data with subdirectories A and B. A and B should each have their own subdirectories train, val, test, etc. In /path/to/data/A/train, put training images in style A. In /path/to/data/B/train, put the corresponding images in style B. Repeat same for other data splits (val, test, etc). Corresponding images in a pair {A,B} must be the same size and have the same filename, e.g., /path/to/data/A/train/1.jpg is considered to correspond to /path/to/data/B/train/1.jpg. 

Our provided DIBaS Sorted Dataset has already been sorted as follows:
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jfPMpKVbrTJhCY1nUnlw3GetuzDloQFEjHqC0JkJvPg/edit?usp=sharing]

Once the data is formatted, call:
```
!python ./datasets/combine_A_and_B.py  --fold_A /path/to/data/A --fold_B /path/to/data/B --fold_AB /path/to/data 
```
where if accessed using Google Drive with shortcut of dataset on My Drive would be 
```
!python ./datasets/combine_A_and_B.py --fold_A /content/gdrive/"My Drive"/finalproject/A --fold_B /content/gdrive/"My Drive"/finalproject/B --fold_AB /content/gdrive/"My Drive"/finalproject/AB
```
- Training

`python train.py --dataroot /content/gdrive/"My Drive"/finalproject/AB --name dibas_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA`

Change the `--dataroot` and `--name` to your own dataset's path and model's name. Use `--gpu_ids 0,1,..` to train on multiple GPUs and `--batch_size` to change the batch size. Add `--direction BtoA` if you want to train a model to transfrom from class B to A.

- Testing
`python test.py --dataroot /content/gdrive/"My Drive"/finalproject/AB --direction BtoA --model pix2pix --name dibas_pix2pix`

Change the `--dataroot`, `--name`, and `--direction` to be consistent with your trained model's configuration and how you want to transform images.
Outputs will be saved in `./results/dibas_pix2pix/tesst_latest/images/`.
